## 💙 Support the Project

This project is developed independently and shared openly with the community to advance practical cybersecurity analytics, threat detection, and research-driven insights.

Your support helps to:

- Maintain and evolve core analytics and detection pipelines  
- Expand dashboards and executive-level visualizations  
- Improve documentation, tutorials, and onboarding materials  
- Support collaborative research, experimentation, and engineering  

In addition to sponsorship, I welcome **direct conversations** with individuals, research groups, and organizations who have:

- Specific cybersecurity analytics needs  
- Custom threat modeling or dashboard requirements  
- Interest in collaborative research or applied projects  
- Ideas for extending or integrating this platform  

If you would like to discuss a project, collaboration, or tailored use case, feel free to reach out directly.
