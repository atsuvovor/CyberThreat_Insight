## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer (Demo & Simulation Use Only)

This repository is a **simulation-based demonstration created for portfolio and educational purposes**.  
All cyber-attack scenarios, datasets, threat metrics, and risk scores are **synthetic and non-operational**.

The project is intentionally designed to **encourage exploration, experimentation, and extension**.  
Readers are welcome to **reuse, adapt, and improve** the modeling techniques, simulation logic, and analytics patterns presented here for learning, research, or prototype development.

This work **does not analyze real systems, networks, or users** and should not be interpreted as a production cybersecurity solution or security advisory.



## Abstract

**CyberAttack-Insight** is a **simulation-based cybersecurity analytics demonstration platform** developed as part of a **professional GitHub portfolio**.
The project illustrates how **synthetic cyber-attack scenarios**, **stacked anomaly detection models**, and **AI-assisted executive reporting** can be designed, governed, and documented in a regulated-enterprise context.

All data, attack behaviors, and risk metrics generated by the platform are **artificial and non-operational**, created solely to demonstrate **technical architecture, analytical rigor, and model governance practices**.
The solution is intended for **educational, evaluative, and portfolio review purposes**, and does **not represent a live or production cybersecurity system**.


## Introduction

Modern cybersecurity analytics platforms are increasingly evaluated not only on detection accuracy, but also on **governance, explainability, auditability, and executive communication**.
CyberAttack-Insight was created as a **demonstration project** to showcase how these requirements can be addressed in a **controlled, simulation-only environment**.

This repository presents a **synthetic cyber-attack simulation framework** combined with a **stacked anomaly detection pipeline** and **automated executive reporting outputs**.
The project mirrors real-world enterprise design patterns—such as Model Risk Management (MRM), data lineage controls, and regulatory documentation—while intentionally using **simulated data and hypothetical attack scenarios**.

The platform serves as a **technical portfolio artifact**, illustrating applied skills in cybersecurity analytics, machine learning, data engineering, and AI-enabled reporting.


## Overview

**CyberAttack-Insight** is a **non-production, simulation-only cybersecurity analytics demo** designed to demonstrate:

* Controlled cyber-attack scenario modeling
* Anomaly detection using stacked ensemble techniques
* ML-safe data engineering and validation
* Executive and board-level reporting automation
* Model governance and audit-readiness concepts

The platform **does not ingest live security data** and **does not detect real cyber threats**.
Instead, it augments **synthetic or sample operational datasets** with **statistically governed attack simulations**, applies an ensemble anomaly detection model, and produces **dashboard-ready tables and executive-style summaries**.

This project is intentionally structured to resemble how **financial institutions, insurers, and regulated enterprises** review analytics platforms—making it suitable for **interviews, technical discussions, and portfolio evaluation**, not operational deployment.

## Portfolio Context

This project was developed as a **GitHub portfolio demonstration** to showcase:

* End-to-end cybersecurity analytics architecture
* Simulation-driven stress testing of anomaly detection models
* Model Risk Management–aligned documentation practices
* Explainable and auditable AI design
* Executive-focused data storytelling

All attack logic, severity scores, and threat metrics are **synthetic abstractions** designed for demonstration only.
No real systems, organizations, or individuals are represented.

### Phishing — Credential Abuse

$$
X_{\text{login}} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)
$$

$$
\text{Impact} \sim \mathcal{N}(5, 3^2)
$$

$$
\text{Threat} \sim \mathcal{N}(6, 3^2)
$$

**Where**

* $X_{\text{login}}$ — Number of login attempts generated during a phishing event
* $\text{Poisson}(\lambda)$ — Poisson distribution with rate parameter $\lambda$, representing the expected number of attempts in a given period
* $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ — Normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$
* **Impact** — Simulated operational impact score
* **Threat** — Simulated threat severity score

*Login attempts follow a Poisson distribution* because phishing attacks generate **many small, repeated login attempts**.
Impact and threat scores use a **normal distribution** to reflect moderate but consistent operational risk.

---

### Malware — System Enumeration

$$
X_{\text{files}} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)
$$

$$
\text{Impact},; \text{Threat} \sim \mathcal{N}(7, 4^2)
$$

**Where:**

* $X_{\text{files}}$ — Number of files accessed or scanned by malware
* $\lambda$ — Expected scanning intensity
* $\mathcal{N}(7, 4^2)$ — Normal distribution centered at higher severity than phishing
* **Impact / Threat** — System compromise severity indicators

Malware tends to **scan files repeatedly**, which is well modeled by a Poisson process.
Severity scores are centered higher than phishing, reflecting **greater system compromise risk**.

---

### DDoS — Resource Saturation

$$
X_{\text{session}} \sim \text{Exponential}(\beta)
$$

$$
\text{Impact},; \text{Threat} \sim \text{Exponential}(8)
$$

**Where:**

* $X_{\text{session}}$ — Duration of network sessions under attack
* $\text{Exponential}(\beta)$ — Exponential distribution with rate $\beta$
* **Impact / Threat** — Severity measures that increase rapidly with resource exhaustion

Session durations follow an **exponential distribution**, capturing the fact that most attacks are short, but a few last a very long time.
Severity escalates rapidly as resources are exhausted.

---

### Data Leak — Exfiltration

$$
X = \mu \cdot e^{\sigma Z}, \quad Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
$$

$$
\text{Impact},; \text{Threat} \sim \mathcal{N}(12, 5^2)
$$

**Where:**

* $X$ — Volume of data exfiltrated
* $\mu$ — Scale parameter representing typical transfer size
* $\sigma$ — Volatility parameter controlling tail risk
* $Z$ — Standard normal random variable
* $\mathcal{N}(12, 5^2)$ — High-impact severity distribution

Data exfiltration follows a **lognormal distribution**, reflecting that:

* Most leaks are small
* A few rare events cause massive losses

This aligns with real-world breach patterns.

---

### Insider Threat — Time-Based Abuse

$$
\text{hour} < 6 \quad \text{or} \quad \text{hour} > 23
$$

$$
X_{\text{transfer}} \sim \text{LogNormal}(\sigma = 0.3)
$$

**Where:**

* **hour** — System access timestamp (24-hour clock)
* $X_{\text{transfer}}$ — Volume of data transferred
* $\text{LogNormal}(\sigma)$ — Lognormal distribution modeling skewed, stealthy behavior

Insider activity is flagged **outside normal business hours**.
Data transfers follow a lognormal pattern, modeling **stealthy but potentially severe misuse**.

---

### Ransomware — Encryption Storms

$$
X_{\text{CPU}} \sim \mathcal{N}(20, 10^2)
$$

$$
X_{\text{memory}} \sim \text{LogNormal}(\sigma = 0.5)
$$

$$
\text{Impact},; \text{Threat} \sim \mathcal{N}(15, 5^2)
$$

**Where:**

* $X_{\text{CPU}}$ — CPU utilization increase during encryption
* $X_{\text{memory}}$ — Memory consumption spike
* $\mathcal{N}(15, 5^2)$ — Highest severity distribution in the simulation
* **Impact / Threat** — Business and operational risk indicators

CPU and memory usage spike sharply during encryption.
Severity scores are the highest, reflecting **business-critical impact and recovery cost**.




## Notes for Reviewers & Regulators

* All distributions are **explicitly defined** for transparency and reproducibility
* Parameters are **bounded in code** to enforce operational realism
* Scores represent **system risk indicators**, not attacker intent or attribution



## ML-Safe Data Engineering

### Sanitization Controls

* NaN / ±Inf handling
* Median imputation
* Numeric casting → `float32`
* Metadata preservation
* Schema enforcement

This prevents **inference-time failures** and supports **model reproducibility**.


## Stacked Anomaly Detection Model

The anomaly detection engine is a **stacked ensemble** consisting of:

* Isolation Forest
* One-Class SVM
* Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
* DBSCAN
* KMeans (distance-based features)
* Dense Autoencoder
* LSTM Autoencoder

A **Gradient Boosting meta-model** produces the final anomaly classification and threat score.

## Conclusion

CyberAttack-Insight demonstrates how a **modern cybersecurity analytics platform could be architected**, governed, and communicated—**without using real data or operational systems**.

By combining **synthetic attack simulation**, **stacked anomaly detection**, and **executive-oriented reporting**, this project highlights practical approaches to:

* Stress-testing analytical models
* Supporting transparent validation and review
* Communicating risk to non-technical stakeholders
* Aligning analytics design with governance expectations

This repository should be viewed as a **technical demonstration and professional portfolio artifact**, intended to spark discussion around **cybersecurity analytics design, AI governance, and model explainability**, rather than as a deployable security solution.
