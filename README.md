## **Abstract**
This project aims to develop an AI-based fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. It focuses on analyzing financial transactions to detect suspicious activities.

---

## **Introduction**
The project leverages Python, machine learning algorithms, and data analysis techniques to detect anomalies in financial transactions. The system is designed to work in real-time environments and provide actionable insights for security teams.

---

## **Project Scope**
The project focuses on transaction data analysis, feature engineering, and building predictive models. It does not cover post-deployment monitoring.

---

## **Data Collection and Integration**
The project uses datasets from financial institutions that include transaction records. Data cleaning and normalization are performed before analysis to ensure data integrity.

---

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA revealed that certain patterns of transactions are more likely to be flagged as suspicious, including high-frequency transactions and unusually large amounts.

---

## **Feature Engineering**
New features were engineered from the transaction data, such as transaction frequency, account age, and average transaction size, which helped improve model performance.

---

## **Model Development**
Multiple machine learning models were tested, with the Random Forest algorithm achieving the best accuracy. The model was trained using a balanced dataset to avoid bias.

---

## **Deployment**
The final model is deployed on AWS using Lambda functions, where it analyzes incoming transaction data in real-time and flags suspicious activities.
