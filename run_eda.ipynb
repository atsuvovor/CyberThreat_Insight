        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The `eda.py` script in the **CyberThreat_Insight** repository automates **Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)** by combining traditional **pandas/numpy-based data inspection** with **AI-powered summarization**. It is designed for portability across **Google Colab**, **Jupyter Notebook**, and **local Python environments**, enabling cybersecurity analysts and data scientists to quickly understand datasets and generate insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Data analysis is an essential step in cybersecurity threat modeling and anomaly detection. Analysts often need to explore datasets quickly to identify trends, distributions, and anomalies. The `eda.py` script bridges **classical EDA techniques** (descriptive statistics, missing value checks, etc.) with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** that summarize findings into **human-readable insights**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach reduces manual effort and accelerates reporting, making it valuable for executive-level presentations and real-time simulation environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Code Structure & Commentary\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* Plots histograms, correlation heatmaps, and categorical distributions.\n",
        "* Supports `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visual clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ Visual EDA complements numerical summaries by revealing hidden structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. AI-Powered Summarization\n",
        "\n",
        "* Uses Hugging Face models (`distilgpt2`, or local alternatives if unavailable).\n",
        "* Summarizes dataset insights: e.g., trends, anomalies, correlations.\n",
        "* Outputs **natural language explanations** for decision-makers.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ“Œ The innovative partâ€”LLMs transform raw statistics into **narrative insights**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Execution Flow\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Context length limits** â†’ Summarization may miss details in large datasets.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Model Upgrades:** Replace `distilgpt2` with **Mistral 7B**, **Mixtral 8x7B**, or **LLaMA 3-8B-Instruct** for better summarization.\n",
        "2. **Chunked Summarization:** Break large datasets into sections to fit within context limits.\n",
        "3. **Interactive Dashboards:** Integrate with **Streamlit** or **Plotly Dash** for real-time EDA.\n",
        "4. **Governance Layer:** Add data masking, compliance checks, and audit trails for regulatory use.\n",
        "5. **Explainability:** Pair LLM summaries with **statistical justifications** (e.g., \"95% of variance explained by top 3 features\").\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "The `eda.py` script provides a **scalable, portable, and AI-augmented** approach to exploratory data analysis in cybersecurity. By merging **traditional statistical techniques** with **AI-powered summarization**, it accelerates insight generation and supports both technical and executive stakeholders. While LLMs introduce challenges like hallucination and performance overhead, future improvements (stronger models, chunking, governance) will make this tool an indispensable part of the data analysis pipeline.\n",
