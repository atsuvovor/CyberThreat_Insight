## 🧪 Code & Quality Guidelines

* Follow existing coding style and structure
* Write readable, well-commented code
* Prefer explicit logic over clever tricks
* Ensure changes do not break existing workflows
* Test dashboards and pipelines locally before submitting



## 📊 Data & Security Considerations

* **Do not submit sensitive, proprietary, or real-world confidential data**
* Use synthetic or anonymized datasets only
* Never embed credentials, secrets, or access keys

### Security Issues

Security-related findings must be reported **privately**, not via public issues.

## 🧠 Research & Collaboration Proposals

If you are interested in:

* Academic collaboration
* Applied research projects
* Custom analytics or dashboards
* Industry or organizational use cases

Please **do not open a pull request directly**.

Instead:
